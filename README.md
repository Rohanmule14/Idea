Agriculture is an important source of livelihood in most parts of the world. It involves tough work but it contributes to food security and the health of the nation.
Farming is an essential element of every country's goodwill. Farmers work day and night to ensure they make the most out of their farm, but farming isnt as easy as anyone may think, infact it involves a lot of hardwork.

I come from a family of farmers and i have seen my family working hard in every condition let it be rainy or extremely hot weather.Agriculture depends highly on weather, and nowadays weather has become very unpredictable.Heavy rain cause serious damage to the crops leading to huge loss of farmers.

My idea to create a online platform for farmers where farmers from all over the country could express their experiences/ideas about farming, like a community of farmers,for the farmers where they interact with each other. For example if a farmer is planning about growing a new crop which he has never grown before he could ask for suggestions or help from other farmers on the platform and get some help. Also include a weather forecast section where one could get detailed information about weather so farmers can be aware of the weather before hand and plan their day accordingly.They can also buy or sell new farming equipment and machinaries through this platform and also get to know about new technologies introduced in farming.So they can get there work done more efficiently and more effectively by getting help at their fingertips.

# SCQ analysis:

(SITUATION):

-> Market value of a particular crop is not stable, when it increases,farmers start producing the crop and at the time of selling the crop in the market,market value suddenly      drops leading to huge loss of farmers.

-> Heavy rainfall and wind storm lead to damage to the crops.

-> Less availability of resoursces and information led them to take wrong decisions,leading to choosing crops which are not really profitable and relatively easy to grow.


(CHALLENGES):

-> Some financially weak or old farmers dont know to use smartphones so they could not benefit form this platform.

-> It will be difficult to make them use such platform as some farmers only believe on practicing old farming methods.


(QUESTIONS):

-> Will farmers trust such a online platform for getting help?

-> Is it possible to let people know about such platform as rural population is not so socially active?

-> From where and how will data regarding weather forecast,farming machinaries and equipments be collected?
